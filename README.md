# Pacemock

NUET-style mock tests with accounts, marks and worked solutions. Live at https://jskskamd.github.io/Pace/

Pacemock is an independent study site, not connected to Nazarbayev University.

## Run it locally

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/. Local logins use the live Supabase project, so they create real data.

## Add or change content

- Mock tests are in `questions.js`. The comment at the top shows every field, and each `image` needs an `alt`.
- List new mocks in `SUBJECTS` in `index.html`.
- After changing a file, raise the `?v=` number in the HTML pages so browsers load the new version.
- If the Supabase project changes, update `config.js` and the `connect-src` address in each page's Content-Security-Policy.
- If the Supabase library version changes, update its `integrity` hash in each page.
